## I imported my table Covid Death and Covid Vaccinations into my data set coronavirus 2022 then i used select and order by to see them in order from continent and location

SELECT *
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY 3,4 

SELECT *
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidVaccinations`
ORDER BY 3,4 

-- Now i am selecing the data i will be using , ordering by location and date. 

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population 
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY 1,2 

-- Looking at the Total Cases vs Total Deaths (chances of dying )

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
ORDER BY 1,2 

-- Looking at the Total Cases vs Total Deaths (chances of dying ) ONLY IN USA
-- Also shows the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in the usa

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location like '%United States%'
ORDER BY 1,2 

--Looking at the Total Cases vs Population 
-- Shows the percentage of population got covid 

SELECT Location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location like '%United States%'
ORDER BY 1,2 

-- I am curious of which countries have the highest infection rates

SELECT Location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, (MAX(total_cases)/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
GROUP BY Location, Population 
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC 

-- Show me the Countries with Highest Death per Population 

SELECT Location, population, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalMaxDeathCount, (MAX(total_deaths)/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationDead
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY Location, Population 
ORDER BY TotalMaxDeathCount DESC 

-- Showing Continent vs Total Death Count 
-- Showing continnents with the highest death count per population 

SELECT continent, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY continent 
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC 

-- GLOBAL NUMBERS

SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS TotalCases, SUM(new_deaths) AS TotalDeaths, SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `coronavirus-2022.CovidDeaths.CovidDeaths`
--WHERE location like '%United States%'
WHERE continent is not null
--GROUP BY date 
ORDER BY 1,2 

-- ok now we are done experimenting with table covid deaths , and now lets explore the other table covid vacccinations
